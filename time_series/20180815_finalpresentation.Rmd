# What is a Time Series: Definition

A sequence of values of a variable at **equally spaced** intervals with a **natural temporal ordering**. 

# What is a Time Series: Johnson and Johnson 

Let's look at a dataset provided in the `astsa` package  which shows **quarterly** earnings per share for Johnson and Johnson from the first quarter of 1960 to the last quarter of 1980.

```{r, echo = TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
require(astsa)
window(jj, 1960, c(1965,4)) 
```

# What is a Time Series: Johnson and Johnson

If we plot the time series, we get:

```{r, echo = TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
plot(jj, type="o", ylab="Quarterly Earnings per Share")
```

# What is a Time Series: Global Temperature

Let's look at another dataset which shows the **yearly** global mean land-ocean temperature deviations (from 1951-1980 average), measured in degrees centigrade, for the years 1880-2015.

```{r, echo = TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
class(globtemp)
window(globtemp, 1880, 1885)
```

# What is a Time Series: Global Temperature

```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(globtemp, type="o", ylab="Global Temperature Deviations")
```

# Key Assumption 

Canâ€™t assume consecutive observations are independent

```{r, echo=TRUE, strip.white=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
jj_v <- unclass(jj)
lag <- lag(jj_v, 1)
lm <- lm(jj_v ~ lag)
cor.test( ~ jj_v + lag, 
         method = "pearson",
         conf.level = 0.95)
```

# Key Assumption

```{r, echo=TRUE, strip.white=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
plot(jj_v, lag, ylab="lag(y)", xlab="y")
```

# Why Care about Time Series?

- They are everywhere!
- Economics (stock market, unemployment, etc)
- Social sciences (population series like birth rates or school enrollments)
- Epidemiology (influenza outbreaks)
- Medicine (blood pressure measurements)

# Working with Time Series

- Time series analysis
    + Analyzing observed data
    + Focus on characteristics of the data
    + Explanatory focus
- Time series forecasting
    + Generating a model
    + Predictive focus

# Some Additional Terminology

- **Stochastic process**
    + A sequence of random variables
    + *Example*: flipping a coin
- **Sample path**
    + Sample path of a stochastic process
    + One sample from a stochastic process
    + *Example*: HTHHTT (six coin flips)
- A stochastic process can generate MANY sample paths (infinitely many)

# Fundamental Stochastic Processes

- White noise
- Moving average
- Random walks

# White Noise

- Fundamental building block of other stochastic processes
- $Y_{t}$ is called white noise (process looks like white light of spectrometers)

**Key**: No correlation between observations

# White Noise: Definition

- Assume $e_{t} \sim N(0,1)$ is a collection of IID random variables all following a normal distribution
- Normal distribution? Anyone? Anyone at all?

\begin{center}
Define $\boxed{Y_{t} = e_{t}}$ for all $t$
\end{center}

- A white noise process satisfies:
    + Mean($Y_{t}$) = constant
    + Var($Y_{t}$) = constant
    + Auto-covariance = 0
    
# White Noise: 1 Sample Path

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

N <- 1L # 50 sample paths
T <- 100L 

# please write your code below
whitenoise <- data.frame(e = rnorm(T*N)) %>%
            mutate(t = rep(1:T,N),
                   path = rep(1:N, each = T)) %>%
            group_by(path) %>%
            mutate(Y = e) %>%
            ungroup()

p5 <- whitenoise %>% ggplot() + 
             geom_line(aes(x = t, 
                           y = Y, 
                           col = factor(path))) + 
             theme(legend.position = 'none')

p5

```

# White Noise: Many Sample Paths

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

N <- 10L # 50 sample paths
T <- 100L 

# please write your code below
randwalk <- data.frame(e = rnorm(T*N)) %>%
            mutate(t = rep(1:T,N),
                   path = rep(1:N, each = T)) %>%
            group_by(path) %>%
            mutate(Y = e) %>%
            ungroup()

p1 <- randwalk %>% ggplot() + 
             geom_line(aes(x = t, 
                           y = Y, 
                           col = factor(path))) + 
             theme(legend.position = 'none')

# White Noise: Implications

Since the data is random there is no point in modeling

# Moving Average

- Assume $e_{t} \sim N(0,1)$ is a collection of IID random variables all following a normal distribution

\begin{center}
Define $\boxed{Y_{t} = \frac{e_{t}+e_{t+1}}{2}}$ for all $t$
\end{center}

- $Y_{t}$ is a type of moving average stochastic process

**Big difference**: there IS correlation between observations

# Moving Average: 1 Sample Path

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

N <- 1L # 50 sample paths
T <- 100L 

# please write your code below
movingavg <- data.frame(e = rnorm(T*N)) %>%
            mutate(t = rep(1:T,N),
                   path = rep(1:N, each = T)) %>%
            group_by(path) %>%
            mutate(Y = (e+zlag(e))/2) %>%
            ungroup()

p5 <- movingavg %>% ggplot() + 
             geom_line(aes(x = t, 
                           y = Y, 
                           col = factor(path))) + 
             theme(legend.position = 'none')

            group_by(path) %>%

# Random Walk

- Assume $e_{t} \sim N(0,1)$ is a collection of IID random variables all following a normal distribution

\begin{center}

Define $\boxed{Y_{t} = e_1 + e_2 + ... + e_{t}}$ for all $t$

\end{center}

- $Y_{t}$ is a random walk

# Random Walk: 1 Sample Path

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

N <- 1L # 50 sample paths
T <- 200L 

# please write your code below
randwalk <- data.frame(e = rnorm(T*N)) %>%
            mutate(t = rep(1:T,N),
                   path = rep(1:N, each = T)) %>%
            group_by(path) %>%
            mutate(Y = cumsum(e)) %>%

# Why Care about Stochastic Processes?

- We have ONE sample path of observations
- From this sample path we intend to infer the stochastic process that generated it
- We are NOT fitting lines to the data
- We are understanding the sample paths the process could take

# Typical Process

- We observe a process to a specific point
- We determine what sample paths are likely as we look later in time

# Stationarity

- Heavily mathematical definition
- Essence of it:
    + The mean (or expected value of the stochastic process) is constant
    + Covariance (or corelation between points only depends on distance between points and not on the value of $t$)
- Stationarity is an extremely common assumption in time series modeling!

# Time Series: Linear Trend

- Assume stochastic process is $Y_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}t + X_{t}$
- Assume $E[X_{t}] = 0$ and $X_t$ is stationary
- This is just like linear regression so let's use OLS

# Time Series: Linear Trend

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
N <- 100
e <- rnorm(N,0,50)
t <- 1:N
Y <- ts(25.0 + 3.0*t + e)
par(mar=c(2,2,0.2,0.2))
plot(Y, type='o')
```

# Time Series

- Linear regression recovers the true parameters (close)
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(broom)
summary(lm(Y ~ 1 + t)) %>% tidy
```

# Time Series: Linear Model for Random Walk

- What if we fit a random walk $Y_t$ with a linear model?
- Put another way: what if we regress a random walk on time with a linear model?
- Good choice, bad choice? 

# Linear Model for a Random Walk

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
N <- 100
e <- rnorm(N,0,50)
t <- 1:N
Y <- cumsum(e)
par(mar=c(2,2,0.2,0.2))
plot(Y, type='o')
```

# Linear Model for a Random Walk

- Linear regression fails. Hard
- Significant trend when there is NOT one
- Reminder: there is not a trend because the expected value of $Y_t$ is $0$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(broom)
summary(lm(Y ~ 1 + t)) %>% tidy
```

# What Happened?

- Spurious regression
- DO NOT regress non-stationary time series
- Our mistake
    + Coefficient is okay
    + Standard error is underestimated
- A random walk does not follow required linear regression assumptions!
    + Which key assumption does it not follow?
